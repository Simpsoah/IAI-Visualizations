IAI Force Directed Visualization
==================
### Description
Visualization to show connectedness of CTSA Twitter accounts and frequency of NIH Tweets. (TODO: I think this description needs updated to something that's correct).

### Requirements
A simple web server
Any modern browser (definition of "modern" to be determined)

### Environment setup
####Workspace setup
As this project uses Angular and JSON loading, you will **need** a simple web server to avoid cross-domain errors. No special configuration is needed. Just drop the files on a web server and point your browser to the page. 

I recommend an [EasyPHP Development Server](http://www.easyphp.org/easyphp-devserver.php) as it is low-profile, quick to configure, and it's really easyphp. 

####EasyPHP Windows configuration

* After installing EasyPHP, start the program. You should see a black **E** on your taskbar. Move to your project directory by right-clicking the E and selecting **Explore**. 
* Drop all of the project files here.
* Navigate your browser to **127.0.0.1/{PROJECT_DIR}**.
* Check the Developer Console in your browser to verify everything has loaded properly.
